Our targets and strategies
We are a team of architects based in Lisbon, London, and Amsterdam with strong relations in Macau – this makes it easy and practical to arrange meetings, discussions and presentations in all locations.
We have studied and practice architecture in various ways, from the smallest object, office buildings, housing, to major urban strategies.
We are connected by a shared vision of community and an ethical way of working where language and shape are secondary to thought and meaning.;
Are you based in Amsterdam and want to develop a project in London?
Are you living in England and need to renovate a house in Portugal?
Are you in Lisbon and need associations in Macau?
We can be your executive architect dealing with planning application processes or overseeing a building site locally while you meet a member of our team wherever you need.

/**TOILETS MACAU**/
Public Toilets – Macau International Airport
200
Client: CAM – Macau International Airport Company
Expansion and renovation of Macau international airport public toilets. A new image – reference to Macau's architectural and urban heritage..
Pero Boi House
2004-2011
Client: Private
House in Castelo de Vide, Portugal
The idea was to build a house that allowed living mainly on the ground floor, while the upper floor could be rented. So the house is composed of two separate levels, communicating by stairs, which can be closed, therefore separating the two worlds. The rotation of the upper plan is ideal for solar panels, which is expressed on the roof fall. All rooms including the bathroom open onto the field, allowing everyone to be independent and the outside to merge with the inside. There was an existing derelict building on site from which the new build borrows the footprint and the stone for the walls. Within the estate there was also build a detached multipurpose small studio.

/**LUANDA HOUSE**/
Luanda House, Angola
2010
Competition: House in Luanda - Patio and Pavillion
Credits: Daniela Castel-Branco, Miguel Cordeiro, Beatriz Talavera and Dion Lembekker
The 30 years civil war accelerated the rural exodus to Luanda. The lack of infrastructures resulted in the invention of survival strategies. Angolan are resourceful, spending their day selling, buying and storing brick by brick. How to incorporate this reality in our design proposal? How to build a sustainable low budget house in a slum? The single house replication determines different neighbourhood blocks. We propose as house extension a frontage space that can be used for a small shop. This double front face is turned to the street working as a buffer for the house private sphere. The common spaces are central where the family gathers and parties. The patio walls are higher to assure the house cooling. All the materials are sourced locally. The tin roof is recyclable and collects rainwater for the garden and toilet.

/**CRUZ DA PEDRA**/
Cruz da pedra
2005-2011
Client: Private
Status: pending
Credits: Pedro Sempiterno, Architect
The main body of the building dates from the XV century, but it suffered many changes through the years. This new program required 13 apartments in order to be economically viable. So a new building is added to the existent. The program also asked for parking and a swimming pool, so the result it’s more or less like a private condominium.

/**ROGAN**/
Rogan Table
2004
Client: private
The exercise was to build a table for two users, husband and wife, with diferent recomendations. He had a good collection of pens, and needed a big surface for he was aparently desorganized, and she needed a big space to store paper and simply drop on the drawers everything she wanted. The result was a composition of two tables, one inside the other, one male and one female... And yes! we tried the IFDA 2002 competition

/**LUBANGO**/
Lubango Master Plan
2003
Client: Huíla Province Government, Angola (CNS))
Designing the master plan for the Lubango city was one of the richest experiences ever. In a place like Angola, one can never think the work is simply intellectual, it requires all our effort and energy and the simplest things. What we do, the way we work is what we teach and what we leave. It´s very simple, everything counts. Photographing the museum collection, preparing an exhibition about the past, the present and the future of the city made part of this experience in Africa.)

/**ALCANTARA**/
Design District Competition
2004
Lisbon's river front

2003
Client: CNBD, Amadora, Portugal
Exhibition design for the best Portuguese comic book of the year by José Carlos Fernandes 7x6 m (42 m2) Room The aim is to communicate the ambience of a jazz bar, creating a universe where time and space twisted to give the impression of physical discomfort. The process consisted of using an optic illusion on the floor and stretching the walls to stimulate the experience. Four chairs were also created, attributing to each character of the story one “impersonated” chair.

/**SPAN HOUSE**/
Refurbishment of a Span house in Blackheath, London
built 1968
Client: private
status: ongoing
This house belongs to a group of 19 which form Parkend, a Span estate in Blackheath, London. Span estates are residential developments build between the 50s and the 80s across the UK, by a company formed by developers (Geoffrey Townsend and Leslie Bilsby), an architect (Eric Lyons) and a landscape architect (Ivor Cunningham). Set in a suburban area where communal gardens help to create a sense of community, Parkend was originally built in 1967. This house has an ongoing refurbishment plan that includes new hardwood windows with double glazing, in adapted replica of the original design, hardwood external cladding with insulation and roof coverings with added insulation. Apart from the upgraded replica elements, some parts of the project are new additions, as the integrity of the original was lost: entrance door panel and hallway, bathroom, kitchen, bespoke integrated storage units and a new garden design.

/**ATOM STAGEWEAR**/
Atom size Stagewear
2008
Credits:Daniela Castel-Branco, Alexandra Varela, Heitor Alves
The pattern uses as inspiration typefaces and calligraphy. In this particular case the first letter of the western alphabet. The fabric was firstly conceived as part of my graduation project. Aware of my fashion background the Atom size singer ask me to design “something she could wear on stage” during the band concert/performances. The Stagewear it is an opportunity to recycle thoughts, a bit in the band improvisation mood. It’s composed by two pieces: First the necklace as wearable as any piece of cloth and second a new use for a t-shirt. The result it’s up-side-down wear. A T-shirt transformed into a XL baggy shorts.

/**INFORMALITY**/
The importance of Informality, learning from Africa. [A Comparative study between Informal settlements and Vinex-districts]]
2011
Location: Angola, Netherlands
Credits: Futurecycles
Status: Granted by the Stimuleringsfonds voor
Futurecycles see informal actions as an opportunity to think globally and to examine urban manifestations which are detached from architecture or urbanism practices. We believe that a research on the unplanned cities will launch clues opposed to urban social pathologies, which can also be found in the planned cities. Once we analyze these informal actions with no prejudgments or presumptions, we hope to unveil a sustainable approach to new urbanity. The intention is to develop a research based on the inherent qualities of informality that can be found in all human settlements, as a universal value.

/**NECK GATHER**/
Neck Gather

Acessory Design and Handcraft
Competition: Unlimited Design Competition 2010 http://unlimiteddesigncontest.org/en/product/neck-gather

The idea gathers two distinct materials in a neck accessory. A Laser cutted plexiglas front and a crochet silk back assembled together. Surprisingly, the contrast between the applied techniques enhances the body anatomy. The front is flat and the back softly surrounds the neck.

/**S4M**/
S4M Skeletons for Mileuristas[Reusing one real estate legacy for a new target group]]
Location: Spain
Status: ongoing
Credits: Futurecycles
The impact of the Spanish crisis in the European Community is directly proportional to the size (10% of EU area) of the country. The Real Estate speculation left behind 1.2 million vacant legacies* and a demand for 760.000 social homes. These facts and figures are the engine of this research. Why is it necessary to build an additional 760.000 homes while there are 1.2 million already unoccupied standing? Although there is no money to finish these buildings, there is a shortage of affordable housing which could be filled by these vacant legacies. There is a need for urgent action to reuse the Skeletons* as potential structures before they fall into disrepair. They could become future homes for an unconsidered social group known as Mileuristas*, who would finally have access to an affordable dwelling.
